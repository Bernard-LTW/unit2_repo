# Project 2 Reflection

## 1. What were the challenges and most enjoyable parts of this project?

The most challenging part for me in this project was the documentation
because it was a bit hard trying to separate and categorize what I coded into different parts and then explaining them.
The coding part was surprisingly less complicated than I thought it would be
and we were able to complete it in a short amount of time.
The most enjoyable part of the whole project is definitely the part
where Alessandro and I filmed the video to explain our whole project.

## 2. What did you do different this time?

One thing I did different was that I did the documentation along the way of coding instead of doing it all at the end.
On the coding aspect, one thing I did different this time is instead of hard coding function,
I used more libraries and thus was able to reuse code and be more efficient.

## 3. What did you learn?

One thing I learned is
that code can be much more efficient if you correctly identify what parts of your code can be reused.
Not to mention, it is also much easier to debug and fix errors if you have a well-organized code.
I also learned to make a scientific poster through this project.

## 4. What are your goals for Unit 3/4?

My goals for Unit 3/4 are to be even more fast and efficient with my coding
and try to code the functions the first time I code instead of reorganising afterwards.
This requires more practice, so I can get better at it.
