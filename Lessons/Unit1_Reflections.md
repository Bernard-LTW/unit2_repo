# Unit 1 Reflections

### What worked well during unit 1?
Time Management. I managed my time outside of class effectively to complete my tasks punctually while also keeping up with my studies and work....

### What did not work well?
Flowcharts and Snakify
The repetitive workload :(

### What did you enjoyed the most during project unit 1?
Gradually being able to code faster and faster in Python because I'm more and more used to the language and the syntax

### What talent have you discovered or practiced during this unit?
I have practiced organising my repository cleanly and have been trying to be more conscious when I code. Not to mention the maths skills from the quizzes and the IB requirements for the documentation.

### What is working well in Computer Science for you?
The quizzes were very fun, except the Flowcharts ;)

### What can Dr Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
